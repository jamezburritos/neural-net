== NEURAL NETOWRK ==

layer:
    contains neurons

neuron:
    contains weights [matrix], and biases [vector]
    produces a vector

training:
    forward ->
    - calculate weighted sum of inputs, using weights
    - add biases to weighted sums
    - apply a function like sigmoid to squish values 0-1

    cost <->
    - calculate the Mean-Squared-Error 
    
    backward <-
    - calculate d(cost)/d(activation)
      - for every weight, calculate dc/dw
      - for every bias, calculate dc/db
    - subtract these values from each weight/bias

testing:
    forward -> 
    - calculate the weighted sum
    - add biases
    - apply squish function

    end -|
    - test accuracy of each prediction
    - calculate a % accuracy for the whole network
